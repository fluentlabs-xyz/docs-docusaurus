Fluent is an EVM-compatible L2 that allows developers to deploy familiar applications written in Solidity. Note however that many of the unique technical value proposition lies in so called [_blended execution_](../../knowledge-base/blended-101.md), but nevertheless migration of existing Solidity based code bases is possible on Fluent.

:::prerequisite

Before getting started, make sure to install either of the following:

* **`gblend`**: find the installation instructions [here](../../gblend/installation.md)
* **Foundry**: find the installation instructions [in the official Foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

:::

If you're starting a new project on Fluent Network, we recommend using `gblend` over regular Foundry forge, even if you have no immediate plans of making your application _blended_ by adding Fluentbase Rust contracts. Your application might still interact with another application that _is_ blended which may lead to issues relying on regular forge.

Nevertheless, as the instructions to build Solidity contracts with `gblend` can be found in [the `gblend` usage docs](../../gblend/usage.md), this guide will use regular forge for demonstration purposes.

## Start Foundry Project

Generate Foundry file in your current directory

```shell
forge init 
```

In the `src` folder, create a new file called `SimpleStorage.sol` and copy the simple contract below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.28;

contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 public storedData; //Do not set 0 manually it wastes gas!

    event setEvent();
    
    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
        emit setEvent();
    }

}
```

### Deploy and Verify 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```shell
forge create SimpleStorage \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz/ \
--broadcast \
--verify \
--verifier blockscout \
--verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="devnet" label="Devnet">

```shell
forge create SimpleStorage \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url https://rpc.dev.gblend.xyz/ \
--broadcast \
--verify \
--verifier blockscout \
--verifier-url https://blockscout.dev.gblend.xyz/api/
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Blockscout verification might fail during deployment.
If this happens, verify the contract after it is deployed.
:::

Make sure to capture the contract address from the output of the deployment step above.

## Verify Contract Already Deployed 

Replace variable `<contract_address>` in the commands below with the actual contract address from the deployment step above and run:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```shell
forge verify-contract \
--rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz/ \
<contract_address> \
SimpleStorage \
--verifier blockscout \
--verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="devnet" label="Devnet">

```shell
forge verify-contract \
--rpc-url https://rpc.dev.gblend.xyz/ \
<contract_address> \
SimpleStorage \
--verifier blockscout \
--verifier-url https://blockscout.dev.gblend.xyz/api/
```

:::summary

Even though Fluent Network has an innovative _blended execution_ engine, it is still an EVM-compatible L2. This means that Solidity contracts can be deployed and verified on Fluent Network just like on any other EVM-compatible network using Foundry and other familiar tools.
