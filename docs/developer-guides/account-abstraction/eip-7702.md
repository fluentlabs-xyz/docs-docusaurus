# EIP-7702: Native Code Delegation for EOAs

## Smart-Account Evolution at a Glance

| Date | What it introduced | What devs gained |
|-------|--------------------|------------------|
| **EOA (2015)** | Single secp256k1 key, nonce, ETH gas | Simple, but no batching, no paymasters, no custom logic |
| **EIP-4337 (2021)** | _UserOperation_, **EntryPoint**, bundlers, paymasters | Batching, pay for gas in tokens, plug-in validation — but required deploying a new contract |
| **ERC-7579 (2023)** | Standard module slots (validator, executor, hook…) | Drop-in extensions: session keys, spending caps, guardians |
| **EIP-7702 (2024)** | `SetCodeTransaction` (type `0x04`) — permanent delegate pointer | Turn any _existing_ EOA into a 4337 wallet with **one tx** |

> **Key idea:** 7702 is the missing bridge — it lets legacy EOAs join today’s 4337/7579 ecosystem **without moving funds or changing address**.

## Overview

**EIP‑7702 lets a plain Externally Owned Account behave like a programmable wallet—without changing its address or moving funds.** A new transaction type, `SetCodeTransaction` (`0x04`), writes a _delegation indicator_ (`0xef0100 || delegate_address`) into the account’s code slot. From that moment, every external or internal call to the account transparently executes the code at `delegate_address` **in the EOA’s own storage and balance context**. The owner can later update or remove the delegation with another `SetCodeTransaction`.

This permanent, opt‑in pointer unlocks powerful patterns:

- **Atomic call batching** – one signature can approve, swap, and stake in a single transaction.
- **Gas sponsorship** – anyone can call the account and pay the fee; the delegate code verifies the user’s intent.
- **On‑chain policy logic** – spending caps, time locks, per‑app sub‑keys, or alternative auth (e.g. WebAuthn) can be enforced inside the delegate contract.

At the same time, 7702 keeps the core EOA model intact. Transactions are still signed with the original secp256k1 key; the global `nonce` rules and ETH‑denominated gas costs remain unchanged; and the protocol itself knows nothing about sub‑keys, paymasters, or account abstraction. Those features live entirely in the delegate contract, which can be swapped or cleared at any time by the account owner.

## Key Concepts

### Native Delegation with SetCodeTransaction

EIP-7702 defines a new transaction type (`0x04`) called `SetCodeTransaction`. This transaction installs a special bytecode in the EOA:

```text
0xef0100 || delegate_address
```

This instructs the EVM to delegate execution to `delegate_address` whenever the EOA receives a call. Importantly, the EOA continues to exist as a regular account with its own key, nonce, and ETH balance.

### Transaction Format

```text
SetCodeTransaction (0x04) = rlp([
  chain_id,
  nonce,
  max_priority_fee_per_gas,
  max_fee_per_gas,
  gas_limit,
  destination,
  value,
  data,
  access_list,
  authorization_list, // NEW
  y_parity,
  r,
  s
])
```

### Authorization List

To prevent unauthorized code delegation, the `authorization_list` requires off-chain approval from the account’s owner:

```text
authorization_list = [[
  chain_id,
  delegate_address,
  nonce,
  y_parity,
  r,
  s
], ...]
```

This structure ensures only code explicitly approved by the user (via ECDSA signature) can be delegated to.

---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atomic call batching**  | Approve → swap → stake in one transaction.                                           |
| **Gas sponsorship**       | Any relayer can pay the fee; delegate code checks the user’s signed intent.          |
| **On‑chain policy logic** | Spending caps, time locks, app‑specific sub‑keys, WebAuthn verification, etc.        |
| **Reversibility**         | Owner can clear or update the pointer at any time with another `SetCodeTransaction`. |

> ⚠️ 7702 itself does **not** add session keys, passkeys, or token‑gas payments; those live in the delegate contract.

## Using EIP-7702 with Smart-Account Workflows  

EIP-7702 is the bridge between a plain EOA and the 4337 smart-account world. One signed message + one transaction turn an address you already own into a fully programmable wallet—while keeping the same key, balance, ENS, and history.

### What 7702 adds on top of 4337

| 4337 alone | 4337 + 7702 |
|------------|-------------|
| Requires deploying a contract (factory call, CREATE2 gas, new address) | Re-uses the _existing_ EOA address—no factory, no asset moves |
| Batching, sponsorship, modules only after deployment | Available immediately after a single “upgrade” tx |
| Hard to migrate legacy users | Seamless one-click upgrade for any EOA |

| Batching, sponsorship, modules only after deployment | Available immediately after a single “upgrade” tx |
| Hard to migrate legacy users | Seamless one-click upgrade for any EOA |

### Conceptual upgrade flow

1. **Select wallet logic**  
   Pick any contract that already implements 4337 validation (e.g. [Kernel](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/getting-started/quickstart-7702), [Simple7702Account](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/accounts/Simple7702Account.sol), or your own module bundle). Call it **delegate**.

2. **User signs one authorization hash**  

   ```text
   authHash = keccak256(chainId ‖ delegate ‖ nonce)
   signature = sign(authHash, EOA_private_key)
   ```

   This proves the EOA owner allows that delegate.

3. **Install the delegate code — choose one of two ways**

   | Path | What gets broadcast | Who pays L1 gas |
   |------|--------------------|-----------------|
   | **A. Direct / Relayed** | A single `SetCodeTransaction (0x04)` that contains `authorization_list = [authTuple]` and writes `0xef0100‖delegate` into the code slot. | Sender (self-fund) **or** any relayer that signs & pays the tx. |
   | **B. Bundled (4337)** | A `UserOperation` with extra field `eip7702Auth = authTuple`. The bundler turns it into `SetCodeTransaction + handleOps` inside one L1 tx. | A paymaster inside the UserOp can cover the fee, giving a true “gasless” upgrade. |

4. **Done — the address is now a smart-account**  
   From the next block every call first executes the **delegate** in the EOA’s own storage/balance context, so all 4337 features—batched actions, paymasters, session keys, 7579 modules—work exactly as if the wallet had been factory-deployed.

5. **Optional: Clear or swap the delegate**

---

### Developer takeaway

- **No new primitives to learn** — keep building with the same 4337 abstractions; 7702 is just a pre-upgrade step.  
- **No address migration pain** — users keep the identifiers and approvals they already use.  
- **Reversible** — the owner can clear or swap the delegate with another `SetCodeTransaction` at any time.

EIP-7702 turns `create a smart wallet` into `upgrade the key you already have` — giving every existing account the modern UX of batching, gas sponsorship, and modular extensions without touching their funds.
