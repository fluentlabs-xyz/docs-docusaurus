Quickstart
---

The guide here goes step by step to explain in detail each part of a template blended application:

- the Solidity contract
- the Fluentbase Rust Contract
- an ethers.js client to interact with those

and gives the instruction to build and deploy the contracts using Fluent's [`gblend` tooling](../../gblend/README.md).

:::tip[Prefer the quickest of starts?]

If you don't want the explanation and simply want to deploy as soon as possible, you can follow the reduced instructions in the [Github repo](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/blended-template-foundry-cli).
