title: Building a Blended App
---

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build a blended application on Fluent.
It combines a Rust smart contract to return value types to a Solidity smart contract.

:::summary

This setup demonstrates:

* composability between different programming languages (Solidity and Rust)
* and interoperability between different virtual machine targets (EVM and Wasm)

within a single execution environment.

:::

:::prerequisite

* **Rust and Cargo**: find the installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* **EVM compatible wallet** for Remix IDE
* **Node.js and npm** (or equivalent): find the installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* **`gblend`**: find the installation instructions [here](../../gblend/installation.md)

If these are set up, get ready to start blending on the next page!
