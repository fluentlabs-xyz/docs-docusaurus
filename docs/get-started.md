The Era of Expressivity is Here
---

![Fluent Banner](../static/img/fluent-banner.png)

Fluent is the first [blended execution network](https://www.fluent.xyz/blended-101) where EVM, WASM, and SVM (soon) contracts talk to each other like they're written in the same language. No bridges. No friction. Just pure _expressivity_.

:::tip The Fluent Advantage

EVM, SVM and Wasm blended into one chain. Build 10x apps with a 10x toolkit.

:::

### Target Audience

The main audience for this documentation are smart contract developers deploying on Fluent, using the `gblend` CLI tool and Fluentbase SDK. To a lesser extent, the documentation also serves infra operators and protocol engineers.

**Choose your adventure and start blending!**

<br />

**ðŸš€ Write in Your Favorite Language**  
Build with Solidity's ecosystem maturity, Rust's performance, or just blend it all in one app.

**âš¡ True Cross-VM Composability**  
Your Rust contract calls your Solidity contract directly. No complex bridging or state synchronization.

**ðŸ”§ Ethereum L2 Benefits**  
Same security guarantees, familiar tooling, existing wallet supportâ€”but with ~~multi-VM~~ _blended VM_ superpowers.

:::note

Currently in public testnet with Solidity, Vyper, and Rust support. More languages coming soon.
