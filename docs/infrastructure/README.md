:::warning[Coming soon: more infra partners integrated]
Fluent is currently in early testnet phase, and we're actively working to integrate more infrastructure providers. Additional partners will be added as we expand our ecosystem. You can check our [Builder Portal](https://testnet.fluent.xyz/builder) for the most up-to-date list of confirmed infrastructure partners.

## Our Infrastructure Philosophy

While **Fluent is fundamentally app-first in our approach**, we recognize that no L2 can thrive without robust infrastructure providers. Our philosophy is simple: we don't just add random infrastructure partners. We carefully curate those that provide the exact services needed to empower developers to build truly differentiated, blended applications.

We strike a deliberate balance between flexibility and being opinionated. Every infrastructure partner we integrate is chosen because they offer specific capabilities that unlock new possibilities for blended app development. This curated approach ensures that developers have access to the right tools at the right time, without being overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.

## Live Infrastructure Partners

Our testnet is supported by the following infrastructure partners:

* **[QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/welcome)**: RPC provider and faucet services for internal and ecosystem teams
* **[Goldsky](./goldsky)**: Blockchain indexing and data infrastructure
* **[Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/)**: Account abstraction and gasless/sponsored transactions
* **[Para](https://docs.getpara.com/v2/introduction/welcome)**: Smart wallet with social login support

:::info[Coming soon: dedicated developer guides]
We're working on comprehensive developer guides for each infrastructure provider. These guides will include step-by-step tutorials, code examples, and best practices for integrating with Fluent's testnet. Stay tuned for detailed documentation on how to leverage each partner's services in your Fluent applications.
