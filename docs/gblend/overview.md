GBlend Overview

## GBlend

A [Foundry Forge](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/gblend) wrapper optimized for Fluent Network and WASM smart contract development.

`gblend` wraps Foundry's Forge and integrates Fluent’s custom REVM, providing a seamless experience for building and deploying WASM-based smart contracts. It enables you to:

- Compile Rust smart contracts for WASM execution
- Deploy contracts to the Fluent Network
- Verify WASM contracts on-chain
- Scaffold new projects using templates from [fluentlabs-xyz/examples](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/examples)

The CLI usage is nearly identical to standard Forge, with a few Fluent-specific extensions. For example, to verify WASM contracts, you must pass the `--wasm` flag.
