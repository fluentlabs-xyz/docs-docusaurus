Using `gblend`
---

`gblend` is a specialized Foundry forge wrapper designed for hybrid Solidity and WebAssembly (WASM) smart contract development on Fluent Network. It seamlessly integrates Rust-based WASM contracts with traditional Solidity development workflows.

The CLI usage is nearly identical to standard Forge, with a few Fluent-specific extensions. For example, to verify WASM contracts, you must pass the `--wasm` flag.

:::tip[Differences from Standard Forge]

- **WASM Support**: Native support for WASM contract compilation and deployment
- **Enhanced Verification**: `--wasm` flag for verifying WASM contracts
- **Custom REVM**: Support for the fluentbase REVM implementation.

:::

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Project

```bash
# Create a hybrid Solidity + WASM project
gblend init my-project

# Navigate to project
cd my-project
```

When creating a new project without using any specific template, the CLI tool will scaffold the [counter + powercalculator](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/examples/tree/main/counter) example. This is an extension to the default Forge counter example when using `forge init`, adding blended execution.

### 2. Project Structure

```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BlendedCounter.sol        # Solidity contract
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ power-calculator/          # Rust/WASM module
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ src/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                          # Forge tests
â”œâ”€â”€ script/                        # Deployment scripts
â””â”€â”€ foundry.toml                   # Configuration
```

### 3. Build Contracts

```bash
# Build all contracts (Solidity + WASM)
gblend build
```

**Note**: First build may take longer as Docker downloads the container image.

The build command will create build artifacts in the `/out` directory or otherwise specified in `foundry.toml`.

These build artificats can be neatly removed from the project by running the clean command:

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
gblend clean
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
gblend test

# Run specific test with gas reporting
gblend test --match-test testIncrementByPowerOfTwo --gas-report
```

## Configuration

`gblend` uses the same configuration foundations as Foundry forge. Create (it should already be there if you used `gblend` or regular `forge` to create your project) or update a `foundry.toml` file in your project root:

### foundry.toml

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
optimizer = true
optimizer_runs = 200

[rpc_endpoints]
fluent_testnet = "https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz"
```

### Rust Configuration (Cargo.toml)

```toml
[package]
name = "power-calculator"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
fluentbase-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase", tag = "v0.4.0-dev" }

```

## Working with WASM Contracts

When building Fluentbase contracts in Rust by using the [Fluentbase SDK](../fluentbase-sdk/build-w-fluentbase-sdk.md), the contracts will be compiled to WASM executables.

:::info[Naming Convention]

WASM contract artifacts follow a specific naming pattern:

- **Package name**: Convert from `snake-case` to `PascalCase`
- **Extension**: Add `.wasm` suffix

Example: `power-calculator` â†’ `PowerCalculator.wasm`

:::

### Building WASM Contracts

When you run `gblend build`, the tool:

1. Compiles Rust contracts inside a Docker container
2. Generates Solidity interfaces in `out/PowerCalculator.wasm/interface.sol`
3. Creates deployment artifacts in `out/PowerCalculator.wasm/foundry.json`

### Using WASM in Solidity

Fluentbase SDK is designed to make it easy for developers to develop blended applications that have seamless cross-VM composability.

Developers can call Fluentbase WASM contracts from Solidity:

```solidity
// Import the generated interface
import "../out/PowerCalculator.wasm/interface.sol";

contract BlendedCounter {
    IPowerCalculator public immutable powerCalculator;
    
    constructor(address _powerCalculator) {
        powerCalculator = IPowerCalculator(_powerCalculator);
    }
    
    function useWasmContract() public {
        uint256 result = powerCalculator.power(2, 8);
    }
}
```

To learn more about how the calls dispatched to Wasm contracts works, check out the [Router macro](../fluentbase-sdk/router.md) in Fluentbase SDK

:::tip[Router Macro]

The router macro provides a robust method dispatch system for Fluentbase smart contracts. It automatically transforms function calls with Solidity-compatible selectors into appropriate Rust function calls, handling parameter decoding and result encoding.

## Deployment

### Deploy WASM Contract

```bash
gblend create PowerCalculator.wasm \
    --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --wasm \
    --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/
```

### Deploy Solidity Contract

```bash
gblend create src/BlendedCounter.sol:BlendedCounter \
    --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --broadcast \
    --constructor-args <powerCalculatorAddress>
```

### Deploy Using Script

```bash
gblend script script/BlendedCounter.s.sol:Deploy \
    --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --broadcast
```

## Verification

Fluent Network uses Blockscout as [its block explorer](https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz) and functionality has been built in to not only verify Solidity contracts, but also Fluentbase Wasm contracts.

### Verify WASM Contract

```bash
gblend verify-contract <address> PowerCalculator.wasm \
    --wasm \
    --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/
```

Pay attention to add the `--wasm` flag when verifying WASM contracts!

### Verify Solidity Contract

```bash
gblend verify-contract <address> BlendedCounter \
    --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/ \
    --constructor-args <args>
```

## Testing WASM Contracts

### In Forge Tests

```solidity
contract BlendedCounterTest is Test {
    address public powerCalculator;
    
    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy WASM contract in tests
        powerCalculator = vm.deployCode(
            "out/PowerCalculator.wasm/foundry.json"
        );
    }
    
    function testWasmIntegration() public {
        IPowerCalculator calc = IPowerCalculator(powerCalculator);
        assertEq(calc.power(2, 3), 8);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Building

:::best-practice[Become a gblend chef]

1. **Always use Docker** for WASM builds to ensure reproducibility
2. **Follow naming conventions** for WASM contracts (PascalCase.wasm)
3. **Test locally** before deployment
4. **Verify contracts** immediately after deployment

:::

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Templates

```bash
# Create a new project with a custom template for example if you want to add a specific WASM contract into existing gblend project
cd src
gblend init -t fluentlabs-xyz/power-calculator power-calculator
```

### Multi-Contract Deployment

```solidity
// script/Deploy.s.sol
contract Deploy is Script {
    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        
        // Deploy WASM contract
        bytes memory wasmBytecode = vm.getCode(
            "out/PowerCalculator.wasm/foundry.json"
        );
        
        address powerCalculator;
        assembly {
            powerCalculator := create(
                0,
                add(wasmBytecode, 0x20),
                mload(wasmBytecode)
            )
        }
        
        require(powerCalculator != address(0), "WASM deployment failed");
        
        // Deploy Solidity contract with WASM dependency
        BlendedCounter counter = new BlendedCounter(powerCalculator);
        
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```
